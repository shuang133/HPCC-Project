# BigQuery Integration with HPCC Systems
The goal of this repository is to provide a set of instructions, sample datasets, and code for creating a successful data transfer from HPCC Systems into BigQuery. The main priority is to find a simple, but effective method that would allow data to transfer from HPCC Systems to BigQuery seamlessly.
# Requirements
* **HPCC Development** Since this is an integration between HPCC Systems and BigQuery, you need to setup the HPCC development on a local machine. This can be done by following the steps in this documentation: https://cdn.hpccsystems.com/releases/CE-Candidate-9.8.4/docs/EN_US/Containerized_HPCC_Systems_Platform_EN_US-9.8.4-1.pdf (p7 - p14).
